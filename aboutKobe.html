      <h1>Before Basketball</h1>
      <p>
        Before basketball launched him into global stardom, Kobe Bryant lived a
        unique and culturally rich life. Born on August 23, 1978, in
        Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he was the youngest of three children and
        the only son of former NBA player Joe "Jellybean" Bryant. When Kobe was
        six, his family moved to Italy after his father continued his
        professional basketball career overseas. Living there for several years,
        Kobe became fluent in Italian and developed a love for soccer while
        still honing his basketball skills. The international experience gave
        him a broader perspective on life and sports, shaping his discipline and
        work ethic from an early age. Upon returning to the U.S. as a teenager,
        he attended Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania, where he quickly
        rose to national attention as a basketball prodigy, setting the stage
        for his legendary NBA career.

      <h1>After Basketball</h1>
      <p>
        After retiring from the NBA in 2016, Kobe Bryant transitioned seamlessly
        into a new chapter of creativity, mentorship, and entrepreneurship. He
        dedicated himself to storytelling and inspiring the next generation,
        founding Granity Studios to produce content that combined sports with
        powerful life lessons. In 2018, he won an Academy Award for Best
        Animated Short Film with Dear Basketball, a poetic tribute to the game
        that defined his life. Kobe also focused on coaching his daughter
        Gianna’s basketball team, becoming a passionate advocate for women’s
        sports. Beyond the court, he was involved in various business ventures,
        wrote children’s books, and mentored young athletes. His post-basketball
        years reflected the same intensity and drive that fueled his playing
        days—centered around growth, excellence, and impact—until his tragic
        death in a helicopter crash in January 2020, which claimed the lives of
        him, Gianna, and seven others.
